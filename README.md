## Reflection 
This was a challenge project built during my 6th module at the University of Birmingahm FE web devopment bootcamp. 

Project goals included using my knowledge of web APIs, objects/data structures, and functions in JS together with HTML and CSS, learned up until this point in the bootcamp to build a dynamic web app.

The main challenge I ran into was checking the user's answer against the correct answer in my question bank's array of objects. This led me to spend a few hours researching, during which I learned a few more window objects, properties and methods that were not covered as part of the bootcamp lesson. 

At the end, the technology implmented in this project are JS, HTML and CSS. 

## Upcoming (New) Features
I plan to include the following features to extend the functonality and UI/UX of this web App

1. Colour to enhance the UI
2. A feature that allows users to log questions into the App and render if desired. On a simplistic scale, this feature will be useful for test providers.
